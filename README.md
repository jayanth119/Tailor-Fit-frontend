# TailorFit Frontend

## Overview
**TailorFit** is an innovative platform designed to modernize traditional tailoring and e-commerce by integrating cutting-edge technologies like Deep Learning (DL), Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR). The application enables users to automate body measurements, visualize clothing virtually, and receive personalized clothing recommendations, enhancing the entire clothing selection and customization experience. 

By bridging the gap between traditional craftsmanship and advanced technology, TailorFit empowers tailors and customers with precision, personalization, and convenience.

## Problem Statement
The tailoring and e-commerce industries face significant challenges:
- **Inaccuracy in Manual Measurements**: Traditional measurement methods are prone to human error and inefficiency.
- **Lack of Visualization**: Customers struggle to visualize how garments will fit or look before making a purchase.
- **Limited Personalization**: Current systems fail to recommend designs suited to individual attributes like skin tone or body type.
- **Disconnected Ecosystem**: There is no unified platform for seamless collaboration between tailors, e-commerce platforms, and customers.

These limitations lead to customer dissatisfaction, reduced confidence, and inefficiencies in scaling tailoring services. Despite advancements in AR, VR, and DL technologies, their integration into the tailoring and fashion industries remains minimal.
