In a ReactJS project, the `src/routes` folder is typically used to store the routing configuration of the application. This includes defining the routes and their corresponding components. This helps in organizing the project structure by keeping all routing-related files in one place. Here is an example of a typical folder structure:

src/
├── routes/
│   ├── AppRoutes.js
│   └── about.txt

- `AppRoutes.js`: This file contains the routing configuration for the application. It defines the routes and maps them to their respective components, enabling navigation between different pages.

- `about.txt`: This file provides information about the `routes` folder and the routing configuration contained within it. It serves as documentation for developers to understand the purpose and usage of the routing files, making it easier to manage and maintain the application's navigation.
