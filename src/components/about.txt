The `components` folder in a ReactJS project is typically used to store all the reusable UI components. Each component usually has its own subfolder containing the component's JavaScript (or TypeScript) file and its corresponding CSS file. This structure helps in organizing the code and makes it easier to maintain and scale the application. For example, the `Header` component has its own folder with `Header.js` and `Header.css` files. Similarly, other components like `Footer`, `Button`, `About`, `Home`, and common components like `Loader` are organized in their respective folders within the `components` directory.
