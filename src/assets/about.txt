In a ReactJS project, the `src/assets` folder is typically used to store static assets such as images, fonts, and other media files. 
This helps in organizing the project structure by keeping all static files in one place. 
Here is an example of a typical folder structure:
src/
├── assets/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── fonts/
│   └── about.txt

- `images/`: This folder is used to store all image files such as logos, icons, and other graphical assets that are used in the project. By keeping all images in one folder, it becomes easier to manage and reference them throughout the application.

- `fonts/`: This folder contains custom font files that are used in the project. Storing fonts in a dedicated folder helps in organizing and maintaining the typography of the application.

- `about.txt`: This file can be used to provide information about the project or the assets contained within the `assets` folder. It can serve as documentation for developers to understand the purpose and usage of the assets.
