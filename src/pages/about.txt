In a ReactJS project, the `src/pages` folder is typically used to store the main page components of the application. Each file in this folder represents a different page or view in the application. This helps in organizing the project structure by keeping all page components in one place. Here is an example of a typical folder structure:

src/
├── pages/
│   ├── HomePage.js
│   ├── LoginPage.js
│   └── about.txt

- `HomePage.js`: This file contains the component for the home page of the application. It defines the layout and content that users see when they visit the home page.

- `LoginPage.js`: This file contains the component for the login page of the application. It includes the form and logic for user authentication.

- `about.txt`: This file provides information about the `pages` folder and the page components contained within it. It serves as documentation for developers to understand the purpose and usage of the page components, making it easier to manage and maintain the application's views.
